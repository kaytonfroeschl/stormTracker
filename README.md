This project was built using: JavaScript, React, MUI, and Node.js

### STEPS TO RUN THE PROGRAM

### Step 1
Before you run the program, you must go to this link:

`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo`

and click the button that says: `Request temporary access to the demo server`

I called the storm data using an API call which had some secruity measures attached to it, so I have to use a CORS server.

### Step 2
In the root of the project type:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Step 3

Click the `Generate` button on the page, and the program will run.
